1. loops great for? Give two reasons why they are great.
    They are great when you want to do the same task/run the same code over and over again, and each time with a different value. In addition, they are also great when working with arrays.

2. The loop syntax?
For loop syntax higher level:
for(initialization; condition; final-expression){statement}

For loop syntax basic syntax:
for (step1; step2; step3){}

3. the for loop basically do??
Loop is considered to be a round trip on roller coaster ride. It comes to the point where it started. In coding terminology, Loop means iteration, it executes all the given commands in the loop in order only if the given condition is satisfied. In addition, loop has three parts basically which initialization, condition, and increment or decrement.

4.example of a for loop, and explain
Example:
for (I = 0; i < 5; i++){
	text += "the number is " + i + "<br>";}

Explaination:
Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0).
Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).
Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.

5.two characters (used in code) represent the for loop code block?
Two characters represent the for loop code block is ({}).

6.After the for loop code block has been executed, which step does the for loop program return to?
After the code block has been executed, it return returns to Step 2(aka condition) which define the condition for executing the code block. In addition, if the value of the condition is true, the loop statement executes. Also, if the value of the condition is false, the for loop terminates. if on the other the condition is not present, the condition is assumed to be true.

7.example for a break statement within the if statement of a for loop.
Example:
int main()
{
      int var;
      for (var =100; var>=10; var --)
      {
           printf("var: %d\n", var);
           if (var==99)
           {
               break;
           }
      }
     printf("Out of for-loop");
     return 0;
}

var: 100
var: 99
Out of for-loop

8. example for a continue statement within the if statement of a for loop
Example:
public class ContinueExample {

   public static void main(String args[]){
	for (int j=0; j<=6; j++)
	{
           if (j==4)
           {
	      continue;
	   }

           System.out.print(j+" ");
	}
   }
}
Output: 0 1 2 3 5 6

9. example of an array.
Example:
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits;
// Banana,Orange,Apple,Mango

10.Another example of an array.
Example:
let animals = ['Dog', 'Cat', 'Pig']
console.log(animals)
// ["Dog", "Cat", "Pig"]

11. initialize and array
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
var x;

for (x of fruits) {
  document.write(x + "<br >");
}

// Banana
//Orange
//Apple
//Mango

12.example of a for in loop

function myFunction() {
  var person = {fname:"James", lname:"Madison", hcolor:"Black"}; 
  
  var text = "";
  var x;
  for (x in person) {
    text += person[x] + " ";
  }
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
}
//James Madison Black

The for-in loop can go through objects and get the properties which have a for-in loop “person” and it has the properties “fname, laname, hcolor.” With a for-in loop the block of code inside the loop executed once for each property. Finally, “James”, “Madison”, and “Black” for the returned.

13. For of loop example
Example:
const numbers = ['0', '1', '2'];

for (const element of numbers) {
  console.log(element);
}

// 0
// 1
// 2
For of loop can go to through the values of an iterable object. In this case, loop “numbers" to get the array values.


14. The (main) difference between a for in loop and a for of loop.
The main difference between a for in loop and a for of loop is for in loop through the properties of an object, and for of loop is through the values of an iterable object.

15. example of a do while loop.
Example:
int main()
{
	int j=0;
	do
	{
		printf("Value of variable j is: %d\n", j);
		j++;
	}while (j<=3);
	return 0;
}

Output:
Value of variable j is: 0
Value of variable j is: 1
Value of variable j is: 2
Value of variable j is: 3

16. Why does a loop (in general) terminate?
A loop (in general) terminates is because it's no longer true for the statment which when the break statement is used with a switch statement, it breaks out of the switch block. This will stop the execution of more execution of code and/or case testing inside the block. When the break statement is used in a loop, it breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop (if any).
